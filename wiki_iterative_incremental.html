    <h1>Iterative/Incremental model wiki</h1>

    <p>
        What is iterative model:<br>
        The iterative model is a type of software development life cycle model that focuses<br>
        on an initial, basic implementation that gradually adds more complexity and a<br>
        broader feature set until the final system is complete.<br><br>

        Main features:<br>
        It enables you to demonstrate and measure the progress of your project without any bias.<br>
        It lets you have a constant improvement in the quality of the project.<br>
        With continuous improvements, it helps you lower down the chances of risk.<br>
        You can experience good improvement in the accuracy of the various estimates that could be part of the project.<br><br>

        Example:<br>
        The iterative model is prevalent in the area of electronics. The evolution of mobile phones over time,<br>
        how speakers have become smaller and more portable over time, or even how refrigerators from the<br>
        same company have altered to accommodate new family needs.<br>
        These are all iterative procedures. Every day, the industry is changing itself in response to client feedback.<br><br>

                    prototypes early in the project lifecycle. This helps clients and stakeholders review and<br>
                    provide feedback based on working software rather than abstract specifications.</td>
                <td>Increased Complexity: In a software development project for a healthcare application,<br>
                    frequent changes to requirements and design during iterations may lead to<br>
                    confusion among team members. This can result in difficulties managing the project,<br>
                    especially when multiple stakeholders demand conflicting updates.</td>

                <td>Costly Development: Developing a mobile app with iterative feedback loops can become<br>
                    expensive due to repeated testing and redesigns. For instance, integrating user<br>
                    feedback for new features like augmented reality may require additional<br>
                    resources and advanced tools, increasing overall project costs.</td>

        What is incremental model:<br>
        Incremental model is a process of software development where requirements are divided into<br>
        multiple standalone modules of the software development cycle. In this model, each module goes<br>
        through the requirements, design, implementation and testing phases.<br>
        Every subsequent release of the module adds functionality to the previous release.<br>
        The process continues until the complete system is achieved.<br><br>

        The various phases of incremental model are as follows:<br>
        1. Initial Planning and Requirements Analysis:<br>
        At the beginning of the project, a comprehensive analysis is performed to identify system<br>
        requirements and prioritize them. This phase lays the groundwork for the entire project,<br>
        identifying the most important functionalities to be developed in early increments.<br>
        For example, a logistics company building a fleet management system may prioritize vehicle<br>
        tracking and route optimization before adding predictive maintenance and fuel consumption analytics.<br><br>
        2. System Design: A general design for the system is created, ensuring all planned<br>
        increments fit together to form a cohesive product.<br>
        The design may evolve as more requirements are clarified.<br>
        In the case of a ride-sharing app, the initial design might include driver and passenger matching,<br>
        with later iterations incorporating dynamic pricing, ride history, and in-app chat.<br><br>
        3. Incremental Development: The system is developed in small, manageable increments.<br>
        Each increment builds on the previous one and includes coding, testing, and<br>
        integration of new functionalities. A digital payment provider, for example, may<br>
        first release a secure payment gateway,<br>
        then expand to include recurring payments and fraud detection mechanisms.<br><br>
        4. Testing and Validation: After each increment, the new features are tested, validated, and refined.<br>
        This ensures that any issues are caught early, reducing the risk of errors as the system develops.<br>
        For instance, in the automotive industry, software updates for self-driving systems<br>
        undergo extensive real-world testing before new features are rolled out to users.<br><br>
        5. Deployment and Delivery: At the end of each increment, the product is delivered to the client,<br>
        providing them with a fully functional piece of the system.<br>
        This iterative process allows the customer to review progress and provide valuable input.<br>
        An enterprise HR platform might first launch employee records management,<br>
        followed by performance tracking and benefits administration modules.<br><br>

        Example of incremental model:<br>
        A practical example of an incremental model is a piece of drawing.<br>
        In this case, the drawer starts with a section of the drawing, and then, he/she keeps<br>
        adding to the drawing piece by piece until it is complete.<br>
        We can thus say that the drawer works incrementally.<br>
        The drawer started from the first iteration and once the module was completed,<br>
        the second iteration started which was the other module.<br>
        Once that was completed, it was then integrated into the first module.<br>
        This was done until the whole product was integrated and ready.<br><br>

                    functional software early in the development lifecycle. This enables users to start<br>
                    utilizing core functionalities while additional features are developed incrementally.<br>
                    In practice, this supports early user engagement and helps businesses realize benefits sooner.</td>
                <td>Complex Planning and Coordination: The incremental model requires detailed upfront<br>
                    planning and coordination to ensure all increments integrate seamlessly.<br>
                    In practice, poor planning may lead to delays or uncoordinated development efforts.</td>

                <td>Flexibility and Adaptability: Changes in requirements or scope can be incorporated<br>
                    more easily during development. This flexibility reduces costs associated with late-stage modifications.<br>
                    For example, if market conditions shift, teams can adapt ongoing increments to align with new demands.</td>
                <td>Potential for Design Issues: Incremental development can sometimes lead to design<br>
                    inconsistencies across modules, especially if changes are introduced mid-process.<br>
                    Fixing issues in one increment often requires adjustments across all others,<br>
                    consuming time and resources.</td>

                    risks can be identified and addressed early in each cycle.<br>
                    Teams can focus on resolving issues in one module before progressing,<br>
                    minimizing the likelihood of widespread problems.</td>

                    The incremental model is generally faster.</td>
