    <h1>FDD (Feature Driven Development)</h1>

    <p>
        <b>What is FDD in Agile?</b><br>
        An Agile methodology for developing software,<br>
        Feature-Driven Development (FDD) is customer-centric, iterative, and<br>
        incremental, with the goal of delivering tangible software results often<br>
        and efficiently. FDD in Agile encourages status reporting at all levels,<br>
        which helps to track progress and results.<br><br>

        FDD allows teams to update the project regularly and identify errors<br>
        quickly. Plus, clients can be provided with information and substantial<br>
        results at any time. FDD is a favorite method among development teams<br>
        because it helps reduce two known morale-killers in the development<br>
        world: Confusion and rework.<br><br>

        First applied in 1997 during a project for a Singapore bank, FDD was<br>
        developed and refined by Jeff De Luca, Peter Coad and others. The<br>
        original project took 15 months with 50 people, and it worked; it was<br>
        followed by a second, 18-month long, 250-person project.<br><br>

        Since then, it’s become a pragmatic approach ideal for long-term,<br>
        complex projects looking for a simple but comprehensive methodology.<br>
        While Scrum and new variations of Agile are more widely recognized<br>
        methods (especially outside of software development), FDD can be a good<br>
        option for software development teams looking for a structured, focused<br>
        Agile methodology that can be scaled across the product organization and<br>
        will deliver clear outcomes.<br><br>

        <b>How is FDD Different from Scrum?</b><br>
         FDD is related to Scrum, but as its<br>
        name implies, it’s a feature-focused method (as opposed to a delivery-<br>
        focused method). Features are a foundational piece of FDD; they’re to<br>
        FDD what user stories are to Scrum: Small functions that are, most<br>
        importantly, client-valued.<br><br>

        <i>“During FDD, a feature should be delivered every 2-10 days – which<br>
        differs from Scrum, in which sprints typically last two, but sometimes<br>
        four, weeks.”</i><br><br>
        
        FDD values documentation more than other methods (Scrum<br>
        and XP included), which also creates differences in the roles of<br>
        meetings. In Scrum, teams typically meet on a daily basis; in FDD, teams<br>
        rely on documentation to communicate important information, and thus<br>
        don’t usually meet as frequently.<br><br>

        Another key difference is the end user; in FDD, the actual user is<br>
        viewed as the end user, whereas in Scrum it’s typically the Product<br>
        Owner who is seen as the end user.<br><br>

        <b>How Does FDD Work?</b><br>
         Typically used in large-scale development projects,<br>
        five basic activities exist during FDD:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop overall model</li>
            <li>Build feature list</li>
            <li>Plan by feature</li>
            <li>Design by feature</li>
            <li>Build by feature</li>
        </ul>
        An overall model shape is formed during the first two steps, while the<br>
        final three are repeated for each feature. The majority (roughly 75%) of<br>
        effort during FDD will be spent on the fourth and fifth steps – Design<br>
        by Feature and Build by Feature.<br><br>

        Teams using all Agile methodologies operate with the primary goal of<br>
        quickly and effectively satisfying the needs of their customers; FDD is<br>
        no exception.<br><br>
        
        However, the difference is that once a goal has been<br>
        identified, teams following FDD organize their activities by features,<br>
        rather than by project milestones or other indicators of progress.<br><br>

        <b>How is a Feature Defined?</b><br>
         In FDD, each feature is useful and important<br>
        to the client and results in something tangible to showcase. And because<br>
        businesses appreciate quick results, the methodology depends on its<br>
        two-week cycle.<br><br>

        <b>Stages of Feature-Driven Development</b><br><br>

        <img src="The-Five-Phases-of-Feature-Driven-Development.png" alt="FDD" width="700"><br><br>
        
        <b>0. Gather Data</b><br>
        As with all Agile methodologies, the first step in FDD is to gain an accurate<br>
        understanding of content and context of the project, and to develop a<br>
        clear, shared understanding of the target audience and their needs.<br>
        During this time, teams should aim to learn everything they can about the<br>
        why, the what, and the for whom about the project they’re about to begin<br>
        (the next few steps will help clarify the how). This data-gathering can<br>
        be thought of as stage 0, but one that cannot be skipped. To compare<br>
        product development with writing a research paper, this is the research<br>
        and thesis development step.<br><br>

        Once teams have a clear understanding of their goals, the targeted<br>
        audience and their current (and potentially, future) needs, the first<br>
        named stage in FDD can begin: Developing an Overall Model.<br><br>

        <b>1. Develop an overall model</b><br>
         Continuing the research paper metaphor, this<br>
        stage is when the outline is drafted. Using the “thesis” (aka primary<br>
        goal) as a guide, the team will develop detailed domain models, which<br>
        will then be merged into one overall model that acts as a rough outline<br>
        of the system. As it develops and as the team learns, details will be<br>
        added.<br><br>

        <b>2. Build a features list</b><br>
         Use the information assembled in the first step to<br>
        create a list of the required features. Remember, a feature is a<br>
        client-valued output. Make a list of features (that can be completed in<br>
        two weeks’ time), and keep in mind that these features should be<br>
        purposes or smaller goals, rather than tasks.<br><br>

        <b>3. Plan by Feature</b><br>
         Enter: Tasks. Analyze the complexity of each feature and<br>
        plan tasks that are related for team members to accomplish. During the<br>
        planning stage, all members of the team should take part in the<br>
        evaluation of features with the perspective of each development stage in<br>
        mind. Then, use the assessment of complexity to determine the order in<br>
        which each feature will be implemented, as well as the team members that<br>
        will be assigned to each feature set.<br><br>

        This stage should also identify class owners, individual developers who<br>
        are assigned to classes. Because every class of the developing feature<br>
        belongs to a specific developer, someone is responsible for the<br>
        conceptual principles of that class, and should changes be required to<br>
        multiple classes, then collaboration is necessary between the owners of<br>
        each to implement them.<br><br>

        And while class owners are important to FDD, so are feature teams. In<br>
        feature teams, specific roles are defined, and a variety of viewpoints<br>
        are encouraged. This ensures that design decisions consider multiple<br>
        thoughts and perspectives.<br><br>

        <b>4. Design by Feature</b><br>
         A chief programmer will determine the feature that will<br>
        be designed and build. He or she will also determine the class owners and<br>
        feature teams involved, while defining the feature priorities. Part of the<br>
        group might be working on technical design, while others work on<br>
        framework. By the end of the design stage, a design review is completed<br>
        by the whole team before moving forward.<br><br>

        <b>5. Build by Feature</b><br>
         This step implements all the necessary items that will<br>
        support the design. Here, user interfaces are built, as are components<br>
        detailed in the technical design, and a feature prototype is created. The<br>
        unit is tested, inspected and approved, then the completed feature can be<br>
        promoted to the main build. Any feature that requires longer time than two<br>
        weeks to design and build is further broken into features until it meets<br>
        the two-week rule.<br><br>

        <b>Conclusion</b><br>
         Feature-Driven Development is a practical Agile approach suited<br>
        for long-term, complex projects. It is a suitable choice for development<br>
        teams seeking a simple but structured Agile method that is scalable and<br>
        delivers predictable results.<br><br>
