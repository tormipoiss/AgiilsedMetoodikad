    <h1>The 12 Agile Principles</h1>

    <img src="agile-principles.png" alt="Agile principles">

    <p>
        <b>Agile Principle 1</b><br>
        “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”<br><br>

        The best ways to ensure you make customers happy while continuously delivering valuable software<br>
        are to ship early, iterate frequently, and listen to your market continually.<br><br>

        Unlike traditional approaches to product development, which have notoriously long development cycles,<br>
        agile principles encourage minimizing the time between ideation and launch.<br>
        The idea is to get a working product in the hands of customers as soon as possible.<br>
        Doing this successfully means product managers are able to quickly get a minimum viable product (MVP)<br>
        out and into the world and use it to get feedback from real customers.<br>
        This feedback is then fed back into the product development process and used to inform future releases.<br><br>

        How it looks in practice:<br>
        Product teams use minimum viable products and rapid experimentation to test hypothesis and validate ideas.<br>
        Frequent releases help fuel a continuous feedback cycle between customer and product.<br>
        Shipped and done are not the same thing. Instead of releasing a “finished” product,<br>
        iterations continue to make incremental improvements to product based on customer and market feedback.<br><br>

        <b>Agile Principle 2</b><br>
        “Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.<br>
        Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.”<br><br>

        In the world around us, change is the only constant.<br>
        Agile principles and values support responding to these changes rather than moving<br>
        forward in spite of them. Previous approaches to product development were often change adverse;<br>
        detailed, well-documented plans were made before development began and were<br>
        set in stone regardless of new findings. Agile principles support observing changing markets,<br>
        customer needs, and competitive threats and changing course when necessary.<br><br>

        How it looks in practice:<br>
        Product teams are guided by high-level strategic goals and perhaps even themes<br>
        below those goals. The product department’s success is measured against progress<br>
        toward those strategic goals rather than by delivery of a predefined feature set.<br>
        Product constantly has its ear to the ground monitoring the market, customer feedback,<br>
        and other factors which could influence product direction. When actionable insight is uncovered,<br>
        plans are adjusted to better serve customer and business needs.<br>
        Product strategy and tactical plans are reviewed, adjusted, and shared on a regular<br>
        cadence to reflect changes and new findings.<br>
        As such, product needs to manage the expectations of executive stakeholders appropriately<br>
        and ensure they understand the why behind changes.<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 3</b><br>
        “Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months,<br>
        with a preference to the shorter timescale.”<br>

        <img src="time.jpg" alt="Agile principles"><br>

        Agile philosophy favors breaking a product’s development into smaller components<br>
        and “shipping” those components frequently.<br>
        Using an agile approach, therefore — and building in more frequent mini-releases<br>
        of your product— can speed the product’s overall development.<br><br>
        This agile approach, with short-term development cycles of smaller portions of the product,<br>
        results in less time spent drafting and poring over the large amounts of documentation<br>
        that characterizes Waterfall product development.<br>
        More importantly, this frequent-release approach creates more opportunities for you<br>
        and your teams to validate your product ideas and strategies from the qualified<br>
        constituencies who see each new release.<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        Agile development cycles, often called “sprints” or “iterations”,<br>
        break down product initiatives into smaller chunks that can be completed in a set timeframe.<br>
        Often this timeframe is between 2 and 4 weeks, which truly is a sprint<br>
        if you consider the marathon-like development cycles waterfall teams often follow.<br>
        Another popular alternative to agile sprints is continuous deployment.<br>
        This method of shipping software frequently works less in terms of predetermined time boxes<br>
        and more in terms of simply deciding what to do and doing it.<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 4</b><br>
        “Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.”<br><br>

        <img src="work-together-principle.png" alt="Agile principles"><br><br>

        Communication is a critical component of any project or team’s success, and agile principles essentially mandate that it’s a daily event.<br>
        It takes a village to raise a child they say, and that applies to product as well.<br><br>
        A successful product requires insight from the business and technical sides of an organization which can only happen if these two teams work together consistently.<br>
        Regular communication between business people and developers helps improve alignment across the organization by building trust and transparency.<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        Cross-functional agile product development teams include product people.<br>
        This means that product is represented on the development team and bridges the gap between technical and business aspects of the product.<br>
        Daily update meetings, or standups, are one technique many agile shops use to put this principle in practice and keep everyone connected.<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 5</b><br>
        “Build projects around motivated individuals.<br>
        Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.”<br>

        <img src="heart_4x3.jpg" alt="Agile principles" width="600px"><br>

        A key part of the agile philosophy is empowering individuals and teams through trust and autonomy.<br>
        The agile team needs to be carefully built to include the right people<br>
        and skill sets to get the job done, and responsibilities need to be clearly defined<br>
        before the beginning of a project.<br>
        Once the work has begun, however, there’s no place in agile for micromanagement or hand holding.<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        Product must clearly ensure engineering understands strategy and requirements<br>
        before development starts.<br>
        This means not only sharing user stories with the cross-functional team<br>
        but also the bigger picture outlined in the product roadmap.<br>
        Product is not responsible for explaining “how” something should be built.<br>
        They need to share what and why, but it’s the delivery team’s job to determine the how.<br>
        Furthermore, during sprints product does not micromanage outcome,<br>
        instead they make themselves available to answer questions and provide support as needed.<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 6</b><br>
        “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.”<br>
        With so many distributed or remote development teams these days, this principle gets a bit of critique.<br>
        But at the root of it, effective communication with developers means getting these conversations out of Slack and email and favoring<br>
        more human interaction (even if done by video conference calls).<br>
        The overall objective behind this principle is to encourage product people and developers to truly communicate in real time<br>
        about the product, requirements, and the high-level strategy driving those things.<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        Daily standup meetings<br>
        Collaborative backlog grooming sessions<br>
        Sprint planning meetings<br>
        Frequent demos<br>
        Pair-programming<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 7</b><br>
        “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”<br><br>

        <img src="working-software-principle.png" alt="Agile principles"><br><br>

        Proponents of the agile philosophy are quick to remind us that we’re in the business of building software, and that’s where our time should be spent.<br>
        Perfect, detailed documentation is secondary to working software.<br>
        This mentality pushes to get products to the market quickly rather than let documentation or an “it’s not done until it’s perfect” mentality become a bottleneck.<br>
        The ultimate measure for success is a working product that customers love.<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        Designing and releasing “Minimum Viable Features” rather than fully-developed feature sets means thinking first and foremost about the smallest things we can ship<br>
        to start getting customer feedback and validate as we continue to build software.<br>
        A fail fast mentality means moving forward even in times of uncertainty and testing ideas rapidly.<br>
        Ship software often: a useful product now is better than a perfect one later.<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 8</b><br>
        “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”<br>
        Keeping up with a demanding, rapid release schedule can be taxing on a team.<br>
        Especially if expectations are set too high.<br>
        Agile principles encourage us to be mindful of this and set realistic, clear expectations.<br>
        The idea is to keep morale high and improve work-life balance to prevent burnout and turnover among members of cross functional teams.<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        Before every sprint, careful consideration of the amount of work that can be committed to is made.<br>
        Development teams don’t over promise on what they can and cannot deliver.<br>
        Effort estimations are a common practice in setting output expectations for development teams.<br>
        Everyone agrees on what will get done during a sprint.<br>
        Once a sprint has begun, no additional tasks are to be added except in rare cases.<br>
        Product managers should act as gatekeepers to reduce the noise from other stakeholders and to avoid squeezing in<br>
        additional unplanned work during an ongoing sprint.<br>
        Product people should do their part in promoting a sense of psychological safety across the cross-functional<br>
        team that encourages open communication and freely flowing feedback.<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 9</b><br>
        “Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.”<br>
        While the agile philosophy encourages shorter cycles and frequent releases, it also puts emphasis on the<br>
        importance of keeping things neat and tidy so they don’t cause problems in the future.<br>
        Product managers often forget about this aspect of development because they mostly don’t spend their days<br>
        wading through their products’ codebases, but it is still of the utmost importance to them.<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        The team needs to be cognizant of technical debt and the technical debt implications of any new features or initiatives added to the backlog.<br>
        Developers and product need to work together to understand if and when technical debt is acceptable.<br>
        On a regular basis, product will need to allocate development resources to refactoring efforts.<br>
        Refactoring cannot be an afterthought, it needs to be an ongoing consideration.<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 10</b><br>
        “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.”<br>
        You’ve probably heard of the 80/20 rule—the concept that you can usually get 80% of your intended results with just 20% of the work.<br>
        Agile principles encourage thinking this way; doing the things that can have the most impact.<br>
        In a product management context this means having a laser sharp focus on organizational objectives and making some cutthroat prioritization decisions.<br>
        Agile principles discourage building merely for the sake of building by emphasizing the importance of being strategic and building with purpose.<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        Product managers need to make very focused product decisions and closely align product strategy with organizational goals while being<br>
        extremely picky about what user stories and features actually make the cut.<br>
        Using prioritization techniques to prioritize initiatives by effort and predicted impact is one way product teams can<br>
        apply this agile principle to product development.<br>
        The short sprints that agile is characterized by present many opportunities for rapid testing and experimentation which can help reduce<br>
        uncertainty around whether initiatives will truly have the predicted impact.<br>
        Using experiments to validate ideas before building them up to spec is a great way to weed out bad ideas and identify good ones.<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 11</b><br>
        “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.”<br>
        In traditional software development methodologies, you’ll often see pyramid shaped teams where management makes key decisions for contributors.<br>
        Agile principles suggest the use of self-organizing teams which work with a more “flat” management style where decisions are<br>
        made as a group rather than by a singular manager or management team.<br>
        The concept ties into agile’s value of teams and interactions over processes and tools, and the intent behind the concept<br>
        is to empower teams to work together as they need to....<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        Self-organizing teams are autonomous groups within the organization who take control and responsibility over their respective projects and have ownership of those areas.<br>
        Different organizations practice this principle differently.<br>
        Spotify, for example uses “product squads” to practice this.<br><br>
        <b>Agile Principle 12</b><br>
        “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”<br>

        <img src="prcs_imprvmnt_tols.jpg" alt="Agile principles"><br>

        If you’re truly living by agile principles, there is no place for “we can’t change because we’ve always done it this way.”<br>
        Just like we’re always learning new things about our customers and markets, we’re also learning from the processes we’re using to learn those things.<br>
        Agile is not about following a strictly-defined process for every sprint and release, it’s about continuous improvement.<br>
        And that continuous improvement must also extend to processes and teams.<br><br>
        How it looks in practice:<br><br>
        Experimentation and testing is not limited to the product only.<br>
        Agile teams are encouraged to experiment with their processes.<br>
        You may think you’re already doing something well only to experiment with a revised version of the process and discover an even more effective method.<br>
        Experimenting with your process and team is just as important as experimenting with the software you’re building.<br>
        Regular retrospectives are opportunities for the team to discuss what went well, what didn’t go so well,<br>
        and where the process can be tweaked to improve things in the future.<br>
        They’re an excellent place for product managers and product owners to learn if they are communicating<br>
        effectively with developers and giving them the support they need before, during, and after sprints.<br>
        Another consideration to make regarding this agile principle is that in order to practice it effectively<br>
        you need to create a culture of trust and transparency that encourages openness and frequent sharing of feedback.<br><br>
