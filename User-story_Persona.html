    <h1>User story and Persona</h1>

    <p>
        <b>What is User Story?</b><br>
        In software development and product management, a user story is an informal,<br>
        natural language description of one or more features of a software system.<br>
        A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a<br>
        description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. A user story<br>
        describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create<br>
        a simplified description of a requirement.<br><br>
        
        User stories are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project<br>
        management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by<br>
        various stakeholders such as clients, users, managers or development team members.<br><br>

        <i>"User stories are part of an agile approach that helps shift the focus from<br>
        writing about requirements to talking about them. All agile user stories include<br>
        a written sentence or two and, more importantly, a series of conversations about<br>
        the desired functionality"</i> - Mike Cohn, a main contributor to the invention of<br>
        Scrum software development methodology<br><br>
        
        <b>Why User Stories?</b><br>
        Requirements always change as teams and customers learn more<br>
        about the system as the project progresses. It's not exactly realistic to expect<br>
        project teams to work off a static requirements list and then deliver functional<br>
        software months later.<br><br>
        
        With user story approach, we replace big upfront design with a "just enough"<br>
        approach. User stories reduce the time spent on writing exhaustive documentation<br>
        by emphasizing customer-centric conversations. Consequently, user stories allow<br>
        teams to deliver quality software more quickly, which is what customers prefer.<br>
        There are quite a few benefits for adopting user story approach in agile<br>
        development such as:<br><br>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The simple and consistent format saves time when capturing and prioritizing<br>
                requirements while remaining versatile enough to be used on large and small<br>
                features alike.<br></li>
            <li>Keep yourself expressing business value by delivering a product that the<br>
                client really needs<br></li>
            <li>Avoid introducing detail too early that would prevent design options and<br>
                inappropriately lock developers into one solution.<br></li>
            <li>Avoid the appearance of false completeness and clarity<br></li>
            <li>Get to small enough chunks that invite negotiation and movement in the backlog<br></li>
            <li>Leave the technical functions to the architect, developers, testers, and so on<br></li>
        </ul><br>

        <b>Basic Concepts of User Story</b><br>
        A user story is a lightweight method for quickly<br>
        capturing the "who", "what" and "why" of a product requirement. In simple terms,<br>
        user stories are stated ideas of requirements that express what users need.<br>
        User stories are brief, with each element often containing fewer than 10 or 15<br>
        words each. User stories are "to-do" lists that help you determine the steps along<br>
        the project's path. They help ensure that your process, as well as the resulting<br>
        product, will meet your requirements.<br><br>
        
        A user story is defined incrementally, in three stages:<br>

        <ul>
            <li>The brief description of the need<br></li>
            <li>The conversations that happen during backlog grooming and iteration planning<br>
                to solidify the details<br></li>
            <li>The tests that confirm the story's satisfactory completion<br></li>
        </ul><br>

        And these, although, are known as the 3C's - Card, Conversation and Confirmation.<br><br>
        
        <b>User Stories - INVEST</b><br>
        The acronym INVEST helps to remember a widely accepted set<br>
        of criteria, or checklist, to assess the quality of a user story. If the story fails<br>
        to meet one of these criteria, the team may want to reword it, or even consider a<br>
        rewrite (which often translates into physically tearing up the old story card and<br>
        writing a new one).<br><br>
        
        A good user story should be - INVEST:<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Independent: Should be self-contained in a way that allows to be released without<br>
                depending on one another.<br></li>
            <li>Negotiable: Only capture the essence of user's need, leaving room for conversation.<br>
                User story should not be written like contract.<br></li>
            <li>Valuable: Delivers value to end user.<br></li>
            <li> Estimable: User stories have to able to be estimated so it can be properly<br>
                prioritized and fit into sprints.<br></li>
            <li>Small: A user story is a small chunk of work that allows it to be completed in<br>
                about 3 to 4 days.<br></li>
            <li>Testable: A user story has to be confirmed via pre-written acceptance criteria.<br><br></li>
        </ul><br>
        
        <b>How to Write User Stories?</b><br>
        When getting started with writing user stories, a<br>
        template can help ensure that you don't inadvertently start writing technical<br>
        tasks:<br><br>
        
        <b>User Story Template</b><br>
        User stories only capture the essential elements of a<br>
        requirement:<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Who it is for?<br></li>
            <li>What it expects from the system?<br></li>
            <li>Why it is important (optional?)?<br></li>
        </ul><br>
        
        Here is a simple format of user story used by 70% of practitioners:<br><br>

        <img src="02-user-story-w.png" alt="User Story Template" width="600"><br><br>
        
        Role - The user should be an actual human who interacts with the system.<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Be as specific as possible<br><br></li>
            <li>The development team is NOT a user<br><br></li>
        </ul><br>
        
        Action - The behavior of the system should be written as an action.<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Usually unique for each User Story<br></li>
            <li>The "system" is implied and does not get written in the story<br></li>
            <li>Active voice, not passive voice ("I can be notified")<br></li>
        </ul><br>
        
        Benefits - The benefit should be a real-world result that is non-functional or<br>
        external to the system.<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Many stories may share the same benefit statement.<br></li>
            <li>The benefit may be for other users or customers, not just for the user in the<br>
                story.<br><br></li>
        </ul><br>
        
        <img src="03-user-story-sticky.png" alt="User Story Example" width="600"><br><br>
        
        <b>Notes:</b><br>
        User stories are written in everyday language and describe a specific goal (what)<br>
        from the perspective of an individual (who) along with the reason (why) he/she<br>
        wants it.<br><br>
        
        In software development, the goal is often a new product feature, the individual is<br>
        some type of end-user and the reason is the benefit that the user sees in the<br>
        targeted product feature.<br><br>
        
        <b>User Story Examples:</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>As a [customer], I want [shopping cart feature] so that [I can easily purchase<br>
                items online].<br></li>
            <li>As a [manager], I want to [generate a report] so that [I can understand which<br>
                departments need more resources].<br></li>
            <li>As a [customer], I want to [receive an SMS when the item is arrived] so that [I can<br>
                go pick it up right away]<br></li>
        </ul><br>

        In the examples above:<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Role represents the person, system, subsystem or any entity else who will interact<br>
                with the system to be implemented to achieve a goal. He or she will gain values by<br>
                interacting with the system.<br></li>
            <li>Action represents a user's expectation that can be accomplished through<br>
                interacting with the system.<br></li>
            <li>Benefits represents the value behind the interaction with the system.<br></li>
        </ul><br>
        
        It is not a rule but a guideline that helps you think about a user story by<br>
        considering the followings:<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>The user story will bring value to someone or certain party (e.g. customers).<br></li>
            <li>The user story is fulfilling a user's need (e.g. receive an SMS when the item is<br>
                arrived)<br></li>
            <li>There is a reason to support implementing this user story (e.g. customer can go<br>
                pick up the item she purchased)<br><br></li>
        </ul><br><br>

        <b>What is a user persona?</b><br>
        A user persona is a fictional representation<br>
        of your ideal customer. You’ll start the design process<br>
        by conducting user research-building empathy with your target users and<br>
        identifying exactly what they need from the product you’re designing.<br>
        A persona is generally based on this user research and incorporates the<br>
        needs, goals, and observed behavior patterns of your target audience.<br>
        Check out the example below:<br><br>

        <img src="example-ux-design-user-persona.jpg" alt="User Persona" width="700"><br><br>

        <b>Why do you need a persona?</b><br>
        Whether you’re developing a smartphone app<br>
        or a mobile-responsive website, it’s very important to understand who<br>
        will be using the product. In order to solve a real user problem, you<br>
        need to have a clear problem statement in mind; in order to write this<br>
        problem statement, you first need to understand your users and their<br>
        needs. Knowing your audience will help influence the features and design<br>
        elements you choose, thus making your product more useful. A persona<br>
        clarifies who is in your target audience by answering the following<br>
        questions:<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Who is my ideal customer?<br></li>
            <li> What are the current behavior patterns of my users?<br></li>
            <li>What are the needs and goals of my users?<br></li>
            <li>What issues and pain points do they currently face within the given<br>
                context?<br></li>
        </ul><br>
        
        Understanding the needs of your users is vital to developing a successful<br>
        product. Well-defined personas will enable you to efficiently identify and<br>
        communicate user needs. Personas will also help you describe the individuals<br>
        who use your product, which is essential to your overall value proposition.<br><br>

        Personas help with strategizing and making smart design decisions. They make<br>
        real users memorable for the product team, helping to focus efforts and build<br>
        empathy.<br><br>

        <img src="definition-multiple-different-personas.jpg" alt="User Persona in UX Design" width="600"><br><br>

        So, in a nutshell, user personas are crucial if you want to design something<br>
        that is useful, desirable, and valuable to your target audience. A solid user<br>
        persona is your northern star, guiding your design decisions from start to<br>
        finish.<br><br>

        Not only that. Most designers work in multidisciplinary teams where it’s<br>
        important to communicate your findings from the user research stage.<br>
        Personas encompass all the essential details about your users, presenting<br>
        them in a memorable way that everyone can understand-not just designers.<br><br>

        <b>How do you define a user persona?</b>
        A well-defined user persona contains four key pieces of information:<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Header<br></li>
            <li>Demographic profile<br></li>
            <li>End goal(s)<br></li>
            <li>Scenario<br></li>
        </ul><br>
        
        Before you create a persona, conduct plenty of research to make<br>
        sure your personas accurately represent your users. After you gather an<br>
        adequate amount of both qualitative and quantitative data, organize the<br>
        information into persona groups that represent your ideal customers.<br>
        Remember to focus on the major needs of the most important user groups-you<br>
        can’t be everything to everyone, nor should you try to be!<br><br>

        Once you’ve got your user groups, you can turn them into user personas.<br>
        Let’s take a look at the four steps that go into creating a user persona.<br><br>

        <b>Step 1: Add a header</b><br>
        The header includes a fictional name, image, and quote<br>
        that summarizes what matters most to the persona as it relates to your<br>
        product. These features aid in improving memorability and keeping your design<br>
        team focused on the users they are building the product for.<br><br>

        Let’s imagine you’re designing a travel app. The foundations of your user<br>
        persona could look like this:<br><br>

        Name: Savannah Rodriguez<br>
        Summary quote: “Take me to undiscovered holiday<br>
        destinations away from the tourist traps.”<br><br>

        This first step might seem simple, but these features ensure that your persona<br>
        is memorable, keeping the design team focused on who they are designing for.<br><br>

        <b>Step 2: Add a demographic profile</b><br>
        While the name and image can be fictional,<br>
        demographic details are factual and based on user research. The demographic<br>
        profile includes four main sections: personal background, professional<br>
        background, user environment, and psychographics.<br><br>

        <b>Personal background</b><br>
        The personal background includes details such as age,<br>
        gender, ethnicity, education, persona group (e.g. working moms), and family<br>
        status (e.g. single, married with children, widowed, etc.).<br><br>

        Savannah’s personal background might be described as follows: Savannah, 52<br>
        years old, a divorced mother of two, has a Master’s degree in chemistry.<br><br>

        <b>Professional background</b><br>
        The professional background includes details such as<br>
        job occupation, income level, and work experience. Here we might add that<br>
        Savannah works full-time at a pharmaceutical company and earns around $65,000<br>
        per year.<br><br>

        <b>User environment</b>
        The user environment represents the physical, social, and<br>
        technological context of the user. This section is used to answer questions<br>
        like: What technological devices do users have access to? Do they spend most<br>
        of their time in a corporate office or a home office? And how often do they<br>
        collaborate with others? So, Savannah’s user environment could be in her<br>
        office, mostly on a laptop, but also on her iPad when commuting to and from<br>
        work.<br><br>

        <b>Psychographics</b>
        Psychographics include details such as attitudes, interests,<br>
        motivations, and pain points. Creating a psychographic profile enables you to<br>
        better understand why your user behaves in a certain way-including why they<br>
        use your product.<br><br>

        Let’s continue to imagine you’re designing a holiday-booking app. Some useful<br>
        psychographic information to include in your user persona could be:<br><br>

        Savannah enjoys luxury spa retreats, hates tourist traps<br>
        Appreciates an element of exclusivity<br>
        Enjoys trying authentic local cuisine<br>
        Prefers to travel alone or with one other person<br>
        Tends to favor quality over economy<br>
        Overall, the demographic profile adds an additional layer of realism to a user<br>
        persona, boosting empathy when exploring user needs and goals.<br><br>

        <img src="what-are-personas-fictitious-users-example.jpg" alt="User Persona Profile" width="600"><br><br>

        <b>Step 3: Add end goal(s)</b><br>
        The end goal is the motivating factor that inspires<br>
        action, and answers the question: what do users want or need to accomplish by<br>
        using your product? End goals are the main driving forces of your users and<br>
        determine what the persona wants or needs to fulfill.<br><br>

        In Savannah’s case, her end goal when using your holiday-booking app is to<br>
        discover and book luxurious, off-the-beaten-track holiday destinations.<br><br>

        <b>Step 4: Add a scenario</b><br>
        A scenario is a “day-in-the-life” narrative that<br>
        describes how a persona would interact with your product in a particular<br>
        context to achieve his or her end goal(s). The scenario usually defines when,<br>
        where, and how the narrative takes place. They are typically written from the<br>
        perspective of the persona and describe use cases that may happen in the<br>
        future.<br><br>

        For example, Savannah’s scenario could start off like this:<br><br>

        “At least once a year, I like to go away on a luxury holiday. I try to<br>
        discover places I’ve never been to before and to stick to destinations that<br>
        aren’t yet overrun with tourists. I work full time, so I don’t have that much<br>
        time to browse and book each individual element of my holiday. Ideally, I’ll<br>
        find some kind of package deal that comes with local restaurant recommendations…”<br><br>

        <b>Additional suggestions</b>
        Each user persona is typically one page, which<br>
        requires you to focus on the essential elements. As a rule of thumb, avoid<br>
        adding extra details that cannot be used to influence the design. If it does not<br>
        affect the final design or help make any decisions easier: omit it.<br><br>

        Personas are also key to finding ideal customers in real life so you can test<br>
        and validate your product with real people. Therefore, make sure each persona<br>
        is specific and realistic: avoid exaggerated caricatures, and include enough<br>
        detail to help you find real-life representation.<br><br>

        <b>5. Final thoughts</b>
        In response to shorter project timelines, personas are the<br>
        go-to method for rapidly identifying user needs. By using real data to develop<br>
        archetypical users, teams can design for personas with the confidence that<br>
        they will also meet the needs of the broader consumer base.<br><br>

        When creating user personas, remember to focus on the context of the product<br>
        you’re designing. While you do want to build up a realistic character, there’s<br>
        no need to include pointless details that won’t influence the final design. If<br>
        you’re designing a holiday-booking app, it doesn’t make sense to include<br>
        information on Savannah’s favorite TV programs or what football team she<br>
        supports. So, only include details that serve a design purpose!<br><br>

        Overall, personas are helpful throughout the entire product development<br>
        phase: from deciding on which features to have in a prototype, to evaluating<br>
        the end product. When combined with additional user experience design methods,<br>
        such as usability testing and task analyses, personas are vital to launching a<br>
        useful and usable solution.<br>
