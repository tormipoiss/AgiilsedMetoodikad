    <h1>Scrum</h1>

    <p>
        <b>What is Scrum?</b><br>
        Scrum is an Agile framework that helps teams collaborate and get high-impact<br>
        work done. The Scrum framework provides a blueprint of values, roles, and<br>
        guidelines to help your team focus on iteration and continuous improvement.<br><br>
        
        The Scrum workflow breaks large projects into smaller fragments that your team<br>
        can work on quickly and iteratively. Because the Scrum process builds off of<br>
        itself and encourages iterative repetition, you can use Scrum to continuously<br>
        improve upon your deliverables until the entire project is completed.<br><br>

        <b>The history of Scrum</b><br><br>

        <img src="history.jpg" alt="Scrum History" width="500"><br><br>

        “Scrum” as it exists today was first introduced in a 1986 Harvard Business<br>
        Review article “The New New Product Development Game”, written by Hirotaka<br>
        Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka. Takeuchi and Nonaka took the name “Scrum” from<br>
        rugby, explaining that “as in rugby, the ball gets passed within the team as it<br>
        moves as a unit up the field.”<br><br>

        Scrum was further developed and codified by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in<br>
        1995, when they published their Agile Manifesto and SCRUM Development Process.<br><br>

        Schwaber and Sutherland’s Scrum was partly a rejection of the waterfall model of<br>
        software development. In the waterfall model, projects are broken into sequential<br>
        phases, where each phase’s deliverables unlock the next phase of work. Schwaber<br>
        and Sutherland believed software developers could benefit from a more flexible,<br>
        iterative approach that allowed them to continuously respond and adapt to their<br>
        environment in order to build the best product for their customers.<br><br>

        Since their initial publication, Schwaber and Sutherland have published the Scrum<br>
        Guide—a living document they update on a regular basis. According to the Scrum<br>
        Guide, Scrum encourages “teams to take a look at how effective their work<br>
        techniques are, and challenges teams to continuously evolve and improve them.”<br><br>

        <b>How the Scrum process works</b><br>
        Traditionally, Scrum is run in a sprint, which are usually two-week-long<br>
        working sessions with specific deliverables due at the end.<br><br>

        There are two additional Scrum events:<br><br>

        - Daily standups. As the name suggests, daily standups happen once a day.<br>
        These are an opportunity for the Scrum team to connect for 15 minutes and<br>
        coordinate daily activities.<br><br>

        - Sprint retrospective. This occurs once the sprint is over. During the sprint<br>
        retrospective, which will be run by the Scrum master, the team has a chance to<br>
        reflect on their sprint and make adjustments for future sprints.<br><br>

        The most important thing to know if you’re going to run a Scrum process is that<br>
        the Scrum framework relies on a system of continuous improvement. In Scrum, you<br>
        recognize you might not know anything at the start of a sprint—and you can adjust<br>
        your processes and needs as needed based on the information you gain during the<br>
        sprint process.<br><br>

        <img src="inline-agile-scrum-1-2x.webp" alt="Scrum Diagram" width="500"><br><br>

        <b>Scrum events</b><br>
        Scrum events, or ceremonies, are the recurring elements<br>
        of each sprint. Each event serves a specific purpose to ensure the<br>
        sprints are structured and productive.<br><br>

        <ol>
            <li>        Organize your backlog. To begin a Scrum sprint, your team lead will<br>
                identify what work to pull from your product backlog—i.e., work that<br>
                needs to be done. In order to have the best Scrum sprint possible,<br>
                make sure you have your product backlog clearly documented in one<br>
                place. Consider using a project management tool to organize all of<br>
                this information.<br><br></li>
            <li>        Hold a sprint planning session. Before you can start your Scrum<br>
                sprint, you need to know what you’ll be focusing on and why. In this<br>
                stage, you’ll define the sprint goals and convey to your team why the<br>
                sprint is valuable to shareholders. From there, you’ll determine which<br>
                sprint backlog tasks you’ll tackle during this specific Scrum sprint<br>
                and how the work will get done.<br><br></li>
            <li>        Start your Scrum sprint. Typically, a sprint is two weeks long,<br>
                though you can have shorter or longer sprints depending on what works<br>
                best for your team. During your sprint, your team will work on the<br>
                items from your backlog that you’ve outlined during your sprint<br>
                planning session.<br><br>
            
                <img src="inline-boards-sprint-planning-2x.webp" alt="Scrum Diagram" width="500"><br><br>
            </li>
            <li>        Host daily Scrum standups. Plan to meet with your Scrum team for 15<br>
                minutes every day. Daily standup meetings are your chance to debrief<br>
                about what you’re working on and triage any unexpected blockers you<br>
                may have run into.<br><br></li>
            <li>        Present your work during the sprint review. Once you’ve finished<br>
                your Scrum sprint, your team should come together for a sprint review.<br>
                During this time, your Scrum team will present the work that’s “Done”<br>
                for stakeholder approval or inspection.<br><br></li>
            <li>
                Connect and reflect during the sprint retrospective. After your<br>
                sprint is over, take some time to discuss how it went and what could<br>
                be improved in the future. Remember that Scrum believes in a process<br>
                of continuous improvement—so don’t be afraid to try new processes or<br>
                rework strategies that feel less effective during your next sprint.</li>
        </ol>

        While these events may seem repetitive, it’s important to include them<br>
        in every sprint, especially if you’re new to Scrum. By doing so,<br>
        you’ll ensure that all departments are on the same page and all<br>
        feedback has been addressed. The events are designed to keep the<br>
        sprints moving quickly and smoothly.<br><br>

        <b>Scrum artifacts</b><br>
        In Scrum, an artifact is something you make, like a tool to solve a problem.<br>
        There are three artifacts in Scrum: the product backlog, the sprint backlog, and<br>
        the product increment.<br><br>

        <b>Product backlog</b><br>

        <img src="Donetonic-Product-Backlog.jpg" alt="Scrum Diagram" width="500"><br><br>

        The product backlog is the master list of work that needs to be done. This list<br>
        should be triaged by the project manager or product owner. Note that just because<br>
        something is in the product backlog doesn’t mean your team will work on it—rather,<br>
        items in the product backlog are options that your team can work on during a Scrum<br>
        sprint. The project owners should frequently reorder and refresh the product<br>
        backlog, based on new information from customers, from the market, or from the<br>
        project team.<br><br>

        <b>Sprint backlog</b><br>

        <img src="Donetonic-Sprint-Backlog.jpg" alt="Scrum Diagram" width="500"><br><br>

        The sprint backlog is the collection of work or products your team has committed<br>
        to for the duration of a Scrum sprint. These items are chosen from the product<br>
        backlog during the sprint planning session, and moved to your team’s sprint<br>
        planning project if you have one.<br><br>

        Your team may not deliver everything in the backlog during every sprint, but it’s<br>
        unlikely that you’ll add to the sprint backlog mid-sprint. If you find yourself<br>
        doing that frequently, spend more time on the sprint planning phase so you have a<br>
        concrete idea of what you’ll be working on during your sprint.<br><br>

        <b>Product increment</b><br>
        The product increment is what you will deliver at the end of a sprint. This can be<br>
        a new product or feature, an improvement or bug fix, or anything else depending on<br>
        your team. Plan to present your increment during the sprint review. At that point,<br>
        it will ship or not ship based on what the Scrum stakeholders think about the<br>
        increment and whether it is “Done.”<br><br>

        In Scrum, nothing is perfect, because your team is flexible and iteratively<br>
        improving. So “Done” doesn’t mean “this can’t get better”—but rather that your<br>
        Scrum team will stop working on it, for now.<br><br>

        For example, here are a few definitions of “Done” for different Scrum teams:<br>
        - Product is ready to be released.<br>
        - Product has been tested and is ready to be released in a beta environment.<br>
        - Product has been acceptance tested and is releasable to all users.<br><br>

        No matter what your team’s definition of “Done” is, make sure everyone is on the<br>
        same page. Once you have your definition, it’s helpful to keep it in a central<br>
        source of truth and reference it frequently, especially during your sprint review.<br><br>

        <b>Scrum roles</b><br>
        In Scrum, team members are assigned to three specific roles: product owner, Scrum<br>
        master, and Scrum team. These roles are used to assign specific tasks to team<br>
        members.<br><br>

        <img src="scrum team.png" alt="Scrum Diagram" width="650"><br><br>

        <b>Product owner</b><br>
        This is the person in charge of the product backlog. They’re connected to the user<br>
        needs and focused on telling the story to their team and other executive<br>
        stakeholders. Good product owners bring clarity about what’s most important to<br>
        deliver next. Ultimately, they should be the person deciding when something is<br>
        ready to ship (with a bias toward shipping frequently).<br><br>

        <b>Scrum master</b><br>
        The Scrum master is the person running the various Scrum events. Think of them as<br>
        the Scrum project manager and facilitator. The Scrum master should facilitate the<br>
        daily standup meetings and host the sprint planning, review, and retrospective<br>
        meetings.<br><br>

        <b>Scrum team</b><br>
        The Scrum team is everyone who is working on the sprint. Team members should be<br>
        self-organizing and collaborative in order to achieve the Scrum goal of continuous<br>
        improvement.<br><br>

        <b>The 6 Scrum principles</b><br>
        Scrum also relies upon six basic principles to ensure the team maintains<br>
        focus and keeps projects on track. The six principles are:<br><br>

        <img src="scrum_3.5_1.png" alt="Scrum Diagram" width="600"><br><br>

        <ol>
            <li>Control over the empirical process. Scrum teams believe in transparency, inspection, and adaptation.<br><br></li>
            <li>Self-organization. Though your Scrum team will have roles and rules,<br>
                every Scrum member is empowered to take ownership of their tasks and their work.<br>
                Scrum believes that shared ownership leads to more creative and dynamic teams.<br><br></li>
            <li>Collaboration. Your team will deliver the best results if you work<br>
                together during and after the Scrum sprint.<br><br></li>
            <li>Value-based prioritization. The goal of a Scrum sprint is to deliver the best business value.<br>
                In order to do that, you have to prioritize your work from the very onset of the Scrum process.<br><br></li>
            <li>Timeboxing. The Scrum process has various time-based activities, such as the sprint itself,<br>
                daily standups, and the retrospective. Because Scrum works on a belief of continuous improvement,<br>
                it’s important to timebox work in order to move on to the next task and improve future work.<br><br></li>
            <li>Iterative development. In Scrum, your first product won’t be perfect.<br>
                But by building iteratively, your team will be most able to adapt to<br>
                customer needs and modify the product and your outputs based on value-based prioritization.</li>
        </ol>

        <b>The 5 values of Scrum</b><br>
        In order to benefit from Scrum, teams need to adhere to the<br>
        five main Scrum values, as defined in the Scrum Guide:<br><br>

        <img src="ScrumValues-1000.png" alt="Scrum Diagram" width="650"><br><br>

        <ol>
            <li>Commitment: The Scrum team is a unit—and team members need to trust one another.<br>
                Scrum team members are committed to the sprint for its duration,<br>
                and dedicated to continuous improvement in order to find the best solution.<br><br></li>
            <li>Courage: During a Scrum, the team might encounter difficult problems<br>
                that have no exact answer. Scrum teams have courage in asking open,<br>
                difficult questions and answering honestly in order to arrive at the best solution.<br><br></li>
            <li>Focus: During any given Scrum sprint, the Scrum team will work from a product backlog.<br>
                The Scrum team is focused on the work they’ve chosen from the backlog in order to<br>
                hit their deliverables by the end of the sprint.<br><br></li>
            <li>Openness: Not everything will go perfectly during Scrum.<br>
                Scrum team members must be open to new ideas and opportunities that both help them<br>
                individually learn and can help improve their product or process.<br><br></li>
            <li>Respect: Collaboration is the key to Scrum—and in order to support team collaboration,<br>
                team members have to respect one another, the Scrum master, and the Scrum process.</li>
        </ol>
