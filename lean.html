    <h1>Lean</h1>

    <p>
        Lean methodology facilitates an ongoing process of incremental adjustment,<br>
        significantly accelerating product delivery by optimizing resources and effort<br>
        and allowing teams to work efficiently and effectively.<br><br>

        <b>History of Lean methodology</b><br>
        Lean methodology aims to fully optimize your team’s process and output<br>
        through continuous improvements. When done well, Lean allows teams to<br>
        deliver customer value efficiently. Toyota Founder Kiichiro Toyoda<br>
        developed the Lean methodology after World War II to conserve<br>
        resources and eliminate waste. After observing the purchasing and<br>
        restocking of items at a supermarket, he conceived the just-in-time<br>
        concept, which focuses on making products exactly when customers need<br>
        them. Toyoda's concept morphed into the Toyota Production System,<br>
        which eventually became the Lean methodology. From these small<br>
        beginnings, Lean evolved into the foundation of Agile project<br>
        management-several industries, including software development,<br>
        construction, and healthcare, now use Lean methodology.<br><br>

        <b>Overview of Lean methodology</b><br>
        Lean methodology rests on two pillars that provide a framework for all<br>
        Lean projects: Continuous improvement and respect for people.<br><br>

        - Continuous improvement: An ongoing feedback loop helps teams make<br>
        progressive changes to processes, products, and personnel to improve<br>
        systems continuously. By identifying, evaluating, and modifying<br>
        existing processes or systems – one cog at a time – teams can eliminate<br>
        waste and improve efficiency on the whole.<br><br>

        - Respect: Managers recognize<br>
        the value of team contributions and customer feedback, and take those<br>
        insights and ideas seriously. Lean managers distribute work throughout<br>
        the workflow in the most efficient manner to encourage close<br>
        collaboration and maximize value to customers. The core principles of<br>
        Lean methodology have been developed with both of these factors.<br><br>

        <b>Principles of Lean methodology</b><br><br>

        <img src="leanprinciples.png" alt="Lean Principles" width="600"><br><br>

        It’s essential to consider the impact your work will have on the<br>
        customer experience. Lean’s five core principles help teams organize<br>
        tasks and provide project managers with oversight. These five core<br>
        principles include:<br>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Identify value</b><br>
                To deliver value to your customers, you must<br>
                first understand their needs. You can do this by:<br><br>
                - Engaging directly with customers to learn about their pain points.<br><br>
                - Identifying how your product helps mitigate those pain points.<br><br>
                Next, you need to define<br>
                your product’s value in meeting customer needs and communicate this<br>
                with your team. You can do this by framing the team’s work around how<br>
                it impacts the customer experience and researching the best tools to<br>
                help your team deliver value to your customers. Identifying value<br>
                saves time and money by ensuring your team builds only features that<br>
                add value for your customers.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li><b>Map the value stream</b><br>
                The activities needed to deliver quality customer experiences form part<br>
                of the value stream. Value stream mapping uses diagrams to help<br>
                visualize the project process, aiding in value stream management, which<br>
                is critical to eliminating waste.<br>
                Value stream mapping involves the following activities:<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Identify the problem and choose the right team:</b><br>
                         Identify your customers’ main pain<br>
                        points, and then choose a team with the skills to solve these problems.<br></li>
                    <li> <b>Bound and map the process:</b>    <br>            Limit the project's scope to necessary activities.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Collect data:</b><br>
                                        Understand what resources are needed by tracking data such as the hours<br>
                                        the team spends working on the project. </li>
                    <li><b>Assess and adjust:</b> <br>
                        To ensure continuous process improvement, constantly assess processes and ask the<br>
                        question, “Is there a better way to do this?”<br><br></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <b>Create a flow</b>       <br>
                A flow state is when the team is in a groove and work is moving<br>
                smoothly, so much so that we don’t notice the passage of time.<br>
                Creating a flow state increases team engagement and performance.<br><br>

                Team flow reflects the efficiency of the value stream, which you can<br>
                continuously fine-tune using the ongoing feedback loop. Lean<br>
                methodology requires a smooth and continuous flow to reduce delays and<br>
                minimize handoff times.<br><br>

                You can improve your team’s flow by implementing the following:<br><br>

                <b>- Cross-functional collaboration:</b><br>
                 Silos are the kryptonite of Lean. Your<br>
                team should participate in the entire process and collaborate with<br>
                other teams, if necessary, to accomplish their tasks. For example, this<br>
                might involve looping in customer success teams and getting their input<br>
                on customer pain points. Moreover, your team can deepen their knowledge<br>
                of how other departments operate.<br><br>

                <b>- Task tracking:</b><br>
                Kanban boards can help you assign tasks, visualize work,<br>
                and coordinate your team. These cards help teams track the progress of<br>
                tasks throughout the project lifecycle .<br><br></li>
            <li> <b>Establish pull</b>       <br>
                With a pull system, teams only work on what the customer needs when<br>
                they need it, producing according to actual customer demand, not<br>
                forecasted projections.<br>
                To accurately assess customer needs, the team must talk to customers<br>
                and seek their input.<br><br>   </li>
            <li>       <b>Seek perfection</b> <br>
                Lean requires a growth mindset and strives for perfection through<br>
                continuous improvement, using an ongoing feedback loop to help the<br>
                project manager, team, and company reduce waste and enhance efficiency.<br><br></li>
        </ol>

                    work around customer needs, eliminating unnecessary work on products<br>
                    and services customers do not want.<br></td>
                <td>        Lack of management support: Unsupportive management can destroy any<br>
                    Lean team and become a roadblock. Fix: Get the team’s buy-in as early<br>
                    as possible and show them how Lean can help.<br>

                    unrealistic deadlines, before they become larger problems. In the case<br>
                    of communication, Lean provides tracking and transparency so everyone<br>
                    is clear on tasks, responsibilities, and deadlines. Since the team<br>
                    participates more closely in the process, they can also push back on<br>
                    any unreasonable timelines.<br></td>
                <td>        Insufficient training: An ill-trained team can negatively impact their<br>
        output. If they don’t understand the Lean process, how can you expect<br>
        them to easily plug into it? Fix: When onboarding the team, provide<br>
        adequate training in Lean methodology. You can enroll your team in a<br>
        Lean certification program that will provide hands-on training. With a<br>
        certification, you’ll be confident that they have the proper knowledge<br>
        of Lean methods.<br>

                    can save money by producing just enough to meet customer demand. That<br>
                    way, you’re not producing more stock than necessary, which is<br>
                    especially important for physical products.<br></td>
                <td>        Focus on tools rather than culture: Putting tools before people<br>
                    decreases team engagement. An emphasis on tools in Lean may dehumanize<br>
                    and devalue your team and their work. When a team doesn’t feel valued,<br>
                    they’re less likely to give their best.<br>
                    Fix: Build a culture of trust using Lean's philosophy of continuous<br>
                    improvement. Providing continuous feedback and opportunities for growth<br>
                    shows that you, as a manager, are interested in your team’s career<br>
                    development.
