    <h1>FDD (What We Did in Class)</h1>

    <p>
        The class took place on 13.05.2025.<br>
        The lesson topic was FDD (Feature Driven Development).<br>
        In class, the teacher talked about FDD and its different stages.<br>
        The teacher explained that FDD is an Agile methodology focused on feature development.<br>
        The stages of FDD were:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop an overall model</li>
            <li>Build a features list</li>
            <li>Plan by feature</li>
            <li>Design by feature</li>
            <li>Build by feature</li>
        </ul>

        To practice these stages, we did various exercises in Miro.<br>
        We did stages 1 - 4 in Miro with the projects: ToDo list and Spotify app.<br><br>

        Here is my Spotify app Miro project:<br>

        Later we also wrote some python code for the Spotify app.<br>
        The teacher wrote code for song searching and<br>
        I wrote code for song filtering by artist.<br><br>
